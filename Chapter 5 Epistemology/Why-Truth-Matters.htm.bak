	<p>In his essay <i>
	<a title="On Bullshit" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit">
	On Bullshit</a></i> (originally written in 1986, and published as a

	<a title="Harry Frankfurt" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Frankfurt">
	Harry Frankfurt</a> of
	<a title="Princeton University" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University">
	Princeton University</a> characterizes bullshit as a form of falsehood 
	distinct from lying. The liar, Frankfurt holds, knows and cares about the 
	truth, but deliberately sets out to mislead instead of telling the truth. 
	The &quot;bullshitter&quot;, on the other hand, does not care about the truth and is 
	only seeking to impress:<sup><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shit#cite_note-8">[8]</a><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shit#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-left: .5in"><i>It is impossible for someone to lie unless 
	he thinks he knows the truth. Producing bullshit requires no such 
	conviction. A person who lies is thereby responding to the truth, and he is 
	to that extent respectful of it. When an honest man speaks, he says only 
	what he believes to be true; and for the liar, it is correspondingly 
	indispensable that he considers his statements to be false. For the 
	bullshitter, however, all these bets are off: he is neither on the side of 
	the true nor on the side of the false. His eye is not on the facts at all, 
	as the eyes of the honest man and of the liar are, except insofar as they 
	may be pertinent to his interest in getting away with what he says. He does 
	not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just 
	picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.</i></p>

	Clive James</a> objected to the use of the word denialist to describe

	<p>But does it really matter? Is it worth bothering about? Academic fashions 
	come and go. Dons and professors are always coming up with some New Big 
	Thing, and then getting old and doddering off to the great library in the 
	sky, while new dons and professors hatch new big things, some more and some 
	less silly than others. Casaubon had his key to all mythologies, Derrida had 
	his, someone will have a new one tomorrow; what of it.</p>
	<p>Yes, is our answer; it does matter. It matters for various pragmatic, 
	instrumental reasons. Meera Nanda discusses in <em>Prophets Facing Backward
	</em>the way Hindu fundamentalists in India have drawn on postmodernist 
	scepticism and hostility to science in “Hinduising” Indian science, 
	education, textbooks and the like. Richard Evans argues in his book <em>In 
	Defense of History </em>that postmodernist scepticism about historical 
	evidence and truth, along with valuable insights, also has dangerous 
	implications.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Nazi Germany seemed to postmodernism’s critics to be the point at which 
	an end to hyperrelativism was called for…There is in fact a massive, 
	carefully empirical literature on the Nazi extermination of the Jews. 
	Clearly, to regard it as fictional, or unreal, or no nearer to historical 
	reality than, say, the work of the ‘revisionists’ who deny that Auschwitz 
	ever happened at all is simply wrong. Here is an issue where evidence really 
	counts, and can be used to establish the essential facts. Auschwitz was not 
	a discourse. It trivializes mass murder to see it as a text. The gas 
	chambers were not a piece of rhetoric. Auschwitz was indeed inherently a 
	tragedy and cannot be seen as either a comedy or a farce. And if this is 
	true of Auschwitz , then it must be true at least to some degree of other 
	past happenings, events, institutions as well. [1]</p>
	<p>&nbsp;That passage is in a book published in 1997. Three years later Evans saw 
	his point enacted in a court of law.</p>
	<p>In the David Irving libel trial held two years ago, in which I served as 
	an expert witness for the High Court in London , Irving was suing Penguin 
	Books and their author Deborah Lipstadt for calling him a Holocaust denier 
	and a falsifier of history. It was not difficult to show that Irving had 
	claimed on many occasions that no Jews were killed in gas chambers at the 
	Auschwitz concentration camp. He argued in the courtroom, however, that his 
	claim was supported by the historical evidence. The defence therefore 
	brought forward the world’s leading expert on Auschwitz , Robert Jan Van 
	Pelt, to present the evidence that showed that hundreds of thousands of Jews 
	were in fact killed in this way. Van Pelt examined eyewitness testimony from 
	camp officials and inmates, he looked at photographic evidence of the 
	physical remains of the camp, and he studied contemporary documents such as 
	plans, blueprints, letters, equipment orders, architectural designs, reports 
	and so on. Each of these three kinds of evidence, as the judge concluded, 
	had its flaws and its problems. But all three converged along the same 
	lines, creating an overwhelming probability that Irving was wrong.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Just as important as this was the fact that it was possible to 
	demonstrate that Irving ‘s historical works deliberately falsified the 
	documentary evidence in order to lend plausibility to his preconceived 
	arguments, principally his belief that Hitler was, as he said on one 
	occasion, “probably the best friend the Jews ever had in the Third Reich”. 
	Falsifying documents involved not just leaving words out from quotes but 
	even putting extra words in to change the meaning. For example, quoting an 
	order from Himmler that a “Jew-transport from Berlin” to the East should not 
	be annihilated as if it were a general order that no Jews at all, anywhere, 
	were to be killed, by the simple expedients of adding an “e” to the German 
	word <em>Transport </em>, making it plural, and omitting the words “from 
	Berlin”, and hoping that other researchers wouldn’t trouble to check the 
	source, or if they did, wouldn’t be able to read the handwriting (which is 
	actually very clear and unambiguous). Or by adding the word “All” to the 
	note of a judge at the Nuremberg Trial in 1946 on the testimony of an 
	Auschwitz survivor which actually said “this I do not believe”, after a 
	small part of her testimony, to make it look as if he did not believe any of 
	it. If we actually believed that documents could say anything we wanted them 
	to, then none of this would actually matter, and it would not be possible to 
	expose historical fraud for what it really is. [2]</p>
	<p>There are also reasons beyond the pragmatic and instrumental, why truth 
	matters, why it can be seen as an inherent good. They are not conclusive, 
	knock-down, irrefutable reasons, they are not mathematical proofs, but they 
	are reasons. We will discuss some in the final chapter. But for now we will 
	content ourselves with some thoughts about what human beings are, and why, 
	being what they are, they should consider truth a very important value, and 
	considering it such, treat it accordingly.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Looked at in that light, the thought that leaps out at us is this: that 
	humans are the only entities in the entire universe, for all we know, who 
	have the capacity to make truth their object. The other needs and wishes, 
	the ones that can conflict with truth, the needs and wishes for contentment, 
	happiness, comfort, feelings of security and safety and being protected, are 
	ones that other beings can want and strive for after a fashion But truth? 
	No. We, by this strange provocative contingent accident of natural 
	selection, have the kind of brain that can conceptualise reality as existing 
	independent of us, and the possibility that we can discover what it is, 
	along with the possibility that we can try to do that and fail, that we can 
	think we’ve discovered it and be wrong, that we can discover part of it and 
	be at a loss about the rest, and so on.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;So one intrinsic reason for thinking we ought to respect the truth, and 
	try to find out what it is, which entails not fudging it whenever we don’t 
	like what we find, which entails deciding firmly <em>in advance </em>that we 
	will put it first and all other considerations second – one reason for all 
	this is simply that we can, and that as far as we know we are the only ones 
	who can. We can, so we ought to. It would be such a waste not to.</p>
	<p>If only as a sort of tribute to the remarkable accident of natural 
	selection. To the staggering amazing chain of being – from nothing to 
	something, to life, to intelligence, to truth-seeking.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;And then, truth can be seen as a major part of the human heritage. Along 
	with the pyramids and the Great Wall and King’s College Chapel, the 
	cumulative gathering up of true knowledge about the world is something that 
	belongs to all human beings across time – particularly of course into the 
	future. It doesn’t belong to any of us in particular, to any one generation, 
	to any mere short-lived <em>set </em>of humans, but to all of us. No one 
	brief generation has the right to tamper with it for the sake of its own 
	ephemeral satisfactions. Think of the Bamiyan Buddhas. How disgusting it was 
	and is that a band of fundamentalist thugs should dare to destroy something 
	that ought to have belonged to all humans across time as well as across 
	space. The truth is a Bamiyan Buddha. It belongs to everyone, not anyone. No 
	one has a right to destroy or distort or damage it for petty temporary 
	political reasons.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;…consider also some of the events which have been played out in recent 
	years at Brigham Young University (BYU), which has its main campus in Provo 
	, Utah . BYU, founded in 1875 by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
	Latter-day Saints (LDS) – that is, by Mormons – is an explicitly religious 
	institution. Its mission statement makes it clear that it exists in order to 
	enrich its students – as it sees it – in the Mormon faith:</p>
	<p>The founding charge of BYU is to teach every subject with the Spirit. It 
	is not intended “that all of the faculty should be categorically teaching 
	religion constantly in their classes, but…that every…teacher in this 
	institution would keep his subject matter bathed in the light and colour of 
	the restored gospel.”</p>
	<p>It is more than a little difficult to imagine quite what this means when 
	it comes to subjects like accountancy and computer engineering. But it is 
	immediately clear that BYU, and indeed other colleges and universities which 
	are founded on religious precepts, differ significantly from their secular 
	cousins. No doubt it is tempting to suppose that this difference necessarily 
	undermines any claim which such institutions make that education and 
	research are about the pursuit of truth. However, this would be to 
	oversimplify; it is quite possible for people to carry out perfectly 
	respectable research, in certain delimited fields, even if they believe that 
	the moon is made of semi-skim yogurt and that a giant pumpkin is God. 
	Religious institutions don’t throw truth out of the window altogether. Their 
	policy is more selective; they keep the bits they like, and discard those 
	they don’t.</p>
	<p>Faculty at BYU are aware that their academic freedom is limited in quite 
	specific ways. The BYU policy on academic freedom is set out in a document 
	which was approved by the university’s trustees in September 1992. It is 
	based on a distinction between “Individual Academic Freedom”, which refers 
	to the “freedom of the individual faculty member ‘to teach and research 
	without interference,’ to ask hard questions, to subject answers to rigorous 
	examination, and to engage in scholarship and creative work”; and 
	“Institutional Academic Freedom”, which holds that it is “the privilege of 
	universities to pursue their distinctive missions”. Bringing these two 
	things together leads BYU to its policy on academic freedom:</p>
	<p>It follows that the exercise of individual and institutional academic 
	freedom must be a matter of reasonable limitations. In general, at BYU a 
	limitation is reasonable when the faculty behaviour or expression <em>
	seriously and adversely affects </em>the university mission or the Church.</p>
	<p>The policy document offers three examples of the kinds of things which 
	staff aren’t permitted to say to students or in public: (a) something which 
	contradicts or opposes LDS Church doctrine or policy; (b) something which 
	deliberately derides or attacks the LDS Church or its leaders; and (c) 
	something which violates the “Honor Code”. [1]</p>
	<p>It’s obvious that such a policy is bound to result in problems. Scholars 
	working in the humanities or the social sciences are very likely to be 
	inquiring into subjects that could bring them into conflict with the 
	specified limitations on academic freedom. This is especially the case since 
	the limitations are vague enough so that what the BYU authorities consider 
	to be a violation might vary over time, and from case to case, and that 
	faculty might not be clear anyway that particular views or activities are 
	unacceptable.</p>
	<p>It is important to make it clear here that there is no evidence that BYU 
	staff are dissatisfied either with the university’s strongly religious 
	nature, or with the fact that their academic freedom is necessarily limited. 
	This is not surprising; some ninety-five per cent of faculty are members of 
	the LDS Church, and also, as a condition of their employment, “temple 
	worthy”, a status attained by only about one in five Mormons. The problems 
	have arisen rather because of the perception that the specified limitations 
	on academic freedom are applied with too much zeal; in particular, there is 
	the suspicion that the policy on academic freedom is used in order to 
	silence viewpoints which are unorthodox only on the strictest interpretation 
	of Church doctrine, even though this is not justified by the letter of the 
	policy. This point is perhaps best illustrated by the case of Gail Hurley 
	Houston, who between 1990 and 1996 was an Assistant Professor in the 
	Department of English at BYU.</p>
	<p>Professor Houston’s story is quite complicated. Indeed, it is the subject 
	of a sixty-two page report by BYU administrators, which itself was the 
	result of an investigation by the American Association of University 
	Professors, which for its part culminated in an eighteen page report.[2] The 
	essence of the story, though, is that Professor Houston’s application for 
	tenure (which went forward, as is standard, as she approached her sixth year 
	of employment at BYU) was denied, despite its being supported by her 
	departmental colleagues, her departmental chair, and two of the three 
	requisite tenure committees. It was rejected at the last stage in the tenure 
	process by the University Faculty Council on Rank and Status; the decision 
	to deny tenure was then confirmed by an Appeal Panel hearing in August 1996.</p>
	<p>Houston ‘s application for tenure was not denied on the grounds of the 
	quality of her scholarship. It was denied because in the eyes of the BYU 
	administration she had engaged in “a pattern of publicly contradicting 
	fundamental Church doctrine and deliberately attacking the Church.”[3] Thus, 
	she was informed that the negative recommendation was because of the number 
	and severity of occasions when your actions and words on and off campus…were 
	perceived as harmful to the tenets held by the Church and the university. We 
	feel that not only have these activities failed to strengthen the moral 
	vigour of the university, they have enervated its very fibre.[4]</p>
	<p>The BYU administration identified a number of specific occasions where 
	they thought her behaviour had transgressed the boundaries set out in the 
	policy on academic freedom. Perhaps most significant were two instances 
	where she suggested that it is appropriate for Mormons to pray to the 
	“Heavenly Mother” as well as to the “Heavenly Father”. The BYU authorities 
	pointed out that she had previously had a warning that such conduct was a 
	clear violation of Church doctrine, and therefore, that it was unacceptable, 
	but that she had subsequently repeated the offence. There were also concerns 
	that she had publicly advocated extending the priesthood to women, again in 
	clear violation of Church doctrine.</p>
	<p>It would be easy to dismiss these worries on the grounds that they are a 
	function of a deeply ingrained sexism which is characteristic of the Mormon 
	religion. However, whilst this is probably true, it nevertheless isn’t clear 
	that the BYU administrators behaved in quite the arbitrary manner that some 
	commentators have supposed. In other words, there is at least an argument 
	that both the following things are true: Professor Houston was the victim of 
	religious intolerance rooted in a sexist theology; and the BYU 
	administrators correctly applied the terms of their policy on academic 
	freedom.</p>
	<p>There is an interesting point here, linked to some of the themes we 
	explored in chapter 5, about how tempting it is to assess this kind of 
	dispute in terms of viewpoints which are rooted in prior political and 
	ideological commitments. Thus, for example, it would be easy for the authors 
	of this book, in line with their atheism, to declare an anathema on BYU, its 
	arguments and works; that is, to decide in advance that the justification it 
	offered for denying tenure to a feminist scholar was necessarily going to be 
	flawed. But if you look closely at the arguments involved in the issue, the 
	matter is not as straightforward as that.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;Consider, for example, the issue of Houston ‘s prayers to a “Heavenly 
	Mother”. The report of AAUP found that BYU had not made their case on this 
	issue, because Professor Houston’s statements about her visions of a Mother 
	in Heaven were a “description of a personal vision,” and did not constitute 
	public advocacy of belief as the administration charged.[5]</p>
	<p>This is pure sophistry. BYU’s addendum to the AAUP document was right 
	when it said:</p>
	<p>The AAUP’s argument that Professor Houston did not “advocate” praying to 
	Heavenly Mother is specious. She publicly announced that she engages in the 
	practice of praying to Heavenly Mother and described what a wonderful 
	experience it is. She even described what Heavenly Father and Heavenly 
	Mother say to her in such prayers…The clear message of her public statements 
	was that it is appropriate to pray to Heavenly Mother, that it is a 
	wonderful experience, and that Heavenly Father and Heavenly Mother accept 
	and respond to such prayers.[6]</p>
	<p>However, and it is an important however, the fact that it is at least 
	arguable that BYU acted within the terms of its own policy on academic 
	freedom in the case of Professor Houston, albeit on the basis of the 
	strictest interpretation of that policy, does not mean that there is no 
	institutional pressure at BYU on faculty. The evidence is that there is 
	institutional pressure; that a significant minority of academics fear 
	precisely that they will fall foul of a strict interpretation of the policy 
	on academic freedom; and, in particular, that feminist scholars tend to 
	attract the often unwelcome attention of the BYU authorities.</p>
	<p>Thus, for example, the AAUP described a visit to the BYU campus at Provo 
	as follows:</p>
	<p>Many faculty members shared in some detail the narratives of their 
	problems with academic freedom, reappointment, promotion, and tenure, 
	frequently producing documents but asking that their names and identifying 
	circumstances not be included in this report. At least two cases are in 
	litigation against the university. Some cases involve issues of personal 
	conduct that are under investigation and others focus on academic research 
	that raises concern with the administration. Several creative artists in 
	different fields told of pressures to alter works to meet unclear 
	administrative agendas…Numerous women, some in groups and some alone, spoke 
	to the investigating committee about the hostile climate for women on 
	campus.[7]</p>
	<p>Reading this, though, one is led to wonder quite what they expected. 
	Religious doctrine is <em>always </em>contested; therefore, disputes about 
	academic freedom are inevitable given the existence of a policy which 
	prohibits overt doctrinal heterodoxy. But it must be said that for a 
	professor at a religious university to complain about this situation is a 
	little bizarre. It comes with the territory. If you’re working within the 
	confines of a revealed truth, then there’s a lot you can’t say. Indeed, with 
	regard to BYU’s antipathy towards certain kinds of feminism, it is not 
	unreasonable to ask, though it certainly isn’t politic, what exactly 
	feminist scholars think they are doing working there in the first place? 
	After all, the LDS Church is hardly covered in glory when it comes to its 
	record on the rights of women.</p>

	<p>In the end, this boils down to preferences. Even the preference for a 
	world where the lies of genocidal tyrannies are eventually corrected is 
	still ultimately a preference. A highly reasonable, well-grounded 
	preference, but still a preference. If we didn’t have minds, and emotions, 
	and the moral thoughts that go with them, mass slaughters would just be 
	something that happened, like rain.</p>
	<p>Some people do prefer to live in a thought-world where priests and 
	mullahs claim to decide what is true. Others prefer to live in a 
	thought-world where ideas about what is true are lenient, flexible, fuzzy 
	around the edges; where it is possible to sort-of-believe, half-believe and 
	half-hope, believe in an as if or storytelling or daydreaming way. Others 
	prefer – genuinely prefer, not merely think they’re supposed to – to try to 
	figure out what really is true, as opposed to what might be, or appears to 
	be, or should be. This is a preference. One can adduce moral and 
	psychological reasons for both preferences. The reasons we’ve given for 
	thinking truth matters rest on preferences, and there’s no final definitive 
	knock-down case for them, at least not that we’ve been able to think up or 
	find. But reasons can be good reasons without being final ones.</p>
	<p>And one last good reason for thinking that truth matters, it seems to us, 
	is all about preferences, in the largest and most humanly important sense. 
	It’s about happiness, flourishing, enthusiasm, about what makes life worth 
	living, why we prefer being awake to being asleep, why it’s a privilege to 
	be human. It’s about why truth <em>matters </em>. Really matters. Not in a 
	dull perfunctory dutiful sense, but in a real, lived, felt sense – “on the 
	pulses,” as Keats put it.</p>
	<p>This is the kind of mattering we’re talking about here – personal but 
	also public, subjective but also communicable and sharable, immediate but 
	also permanent, cognitive but also emotional. In a way it’s just as much 
	about community and solidarity as Rorty’s vision is, but it’s a community 
	that thinks truth matters rather than one that prefers solidarity to truth. 
	Truth is perhaps the capital city on that mattering map.</p>
	<p>This reason is based on the thought that inquiry, curiosity, interest, 
	investigation, explanation-seeking, are hugely important components of human 
	happiness. This doesn’t seem to be a terribly popular thought right now. 
	Public rhetoric tends to aim much lower, for some reason. It seems to see us 
	all as hunkered down, and settling. Settling for minimal, parochial, almost 
	biological satisfactions – family, safety, money. But that underestimates 
	us. We want more than that. We want to ask questions, we want to learn, we 
	want to understand. That’s a very human taste and pleasure. Again, as we 
	said in Chapter 1, it seems a waste not to use human capacities and 
	abilities. Anyone can settle for just survival and reproduction and comfort, 
	but we can do more. It’s a privilege, that is – it seems a kind of sacrilege 
	not to use it.</p>
	<p>And real inquiry presupposes that truth matters. That it is true that 
	there is a truth of the matter we’re investigating, even if it turns out 
	that we can’t find it. Maybe the next generation can, or two or three or ten 
	after that, or maybe just someone more skilled than we are. But we have to 
	think there is something to find in order for inquiry to be genuine inquiry 
	and not just an arbitrary game that doesn’t go anywhere. We like games, but 
	we also like genuine inquiry. <em>That’s </em>why truth matters.</p>
	<p>Postmodern (and postmodern-aided traditional) attacks on science and 
	truth of the sort quoted above tend to frame science and inquiry as 
	impoverished in various ways: arid, cold, unfeeling, mechanical, dull, empty 
	of poetry and colour and life, devoid of wonder. This is an old Romantic 
	trope – Blake’s “single vision and Newton ‘s sleep,” Keats’ “cold philosophy 
	would clip an angel’s wings,” Wordsworth’s “they murder to dissect.” But 
	scientists with real experience of inquiry and discovery think that Blake, 
	Keats and Wordsworth were simply wrong, and that so are their contemporary 
	avatars. Richard Dawkins for example:</p>
	<p>To accuse science of robbing life of the warmth that makes it worth 
	living is so preposterously mistaken, so diametrically opposed to my own 
	feelings and those of most working scientists, I am almost driven to the 
	despair of which I am wrongly suspected…The feeling of awed wonder that 
	science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human 
	psyche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest 
	that music and poetry can deliver. [1]</p>
	<p>And Matt Ridley:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;The one thing I would try to teach the world about science is <em>that 
	science is not a catalogue of facts, but a search for new mysteries </em>. 
	Science increases the store of wonder and mystery in the world; it does not 
	erode it.</p>
	<p>The myth, started by the Romantic poets, that science gets rid of 
	mysteries was well nailed by Albert Einstein – whose thought experiments 
	about relativity are far more otherworldly, elusive, thrilling and baffling 
	than anything dreamt up by poets. Isaac Newton showed us the mysteries of 
	deep space, Charles Darwin showed us the mysteries of deep time, and Francis 
	Crick and James D Watson showed us the mysteries of deep encoding. To get 
	rid of those insights would be to reduce the world’s stock of awe. [2]</p>
	<p>&nbsp;That’s why truth matters.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
